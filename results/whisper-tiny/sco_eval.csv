So I've recently bought a slow cooker and became a bit of a obsessed with it which I think comes back to my bit of born and then probably definitely approaching my delayed Um but I actually great wee thing for- for my kind of fine food I used to have a bit of a problem that passed with me- you would- you would cook me to let it be tough and um sort of nae easy to chak Whereas if you do stuff in the slow cooker you just stick it on in the morning leave it cook in for hours and then you come to it night and it’s half-fifth and you just leave it for a while and then you just take it to a’ the chak and then you just take it to a’ the chak and then you just take it to a’ the chak and then you just take it to a’ the chak and then you just take it to a’ the,So I recently bought a slow cooker and became a bittie obsessed with it which I think maks me a bittie boring and probably definitely approaching middle-aged Eh but aye it’s a great wee thing for- for making fine food I aieways had a problem in the past with with meat and you- you would cook meat and it would be tough and eh sort of no easy to chew Whereas if you do stuff in the slow cooker you just stick it on in the morning leave it cooking for hours and hours and then you come to it at night and it’s a’ fine and the meat’s tender and it tastes good Eh so aye it’s quite an easy way to- an easy way to cook and there’s less washing up at the end because you’ve just got the one big pot to stick in the sink Eh probably my favourite thing to mak in the slow cooker is I- I do a good slow cooker beef stew Eh so I mak it with chunks of beef and a- and carrots and ingens and mushrooms sometimes Eh and then I pour in a whole can of Guinness and it gives it a really really fine taste Eh and then so usually when we hae that stew we hae it with tatties- mashed tatties And then if we’re feeling like treating oursels I’ll maybe roll oot a wee square of puff pastry and stick that in the- in the oven and then stick that on the top of it to mak it into a- into a steak pie So that’s probably ain of my maist successful recipies I’m no much of a cook I dinna really-I’m no that good at cooking Eh I’m getting better I’m getting better as I get older And eh yeah the slow cooker has definitely been a- a good addition Eh we’ve- we’ve got an air fryer A lot of folk are awfu’ obsessed with air fryers just noo We have got an air fryer and yeah it’s- it’s good for some things Eh,0.7771428571428571

It’s a difficult aim ‘cause I absolutely love holidays Like I just own life for holidays I think that’s one of the reasons that- that- how work is so that I can afford to ging in holidays So I’ve really lucky that I’ve been to lots of the only cool places Um best holiday to everyone’s the I think I- Ive used- w- a few years ago we went to Italy and we’d been to Italy quite a few times before but it’s time to go to Italy and it’s just so- so yeah I think it’s a lot of difficult to do Um yeah I think it’s really- really really really really good at it ,This is a difficult ain ‘cause I absolutely love holidays like I just live for holidays I think that’s one of the only reasons that- that- that I work is so that I can afford to ging on holidays So I’m really lucky that I’ve been lots of really cool places Eh best holiday ever let’s hae a think I recent- a few years ago we went to Italy And we’d been to Italy quite a few times afore but this time we rented a car and we bed in a few different places a few different hotels and sort off potted it oot And I think that was a really good- a really good holiday we saw lots of places Like I dinna think you can beat Italy for food like pizzas and pasta and athing it’s so fine a’ the ice cream Eh and I think compared to previous holidays farr we’d been in like France Italy Spain and so on eh it was the first time we’d rented a car abroad And it maks a big difference in terms of the amount of stuff that you can see but it also makes a big difference in terms of the air-conditioning because if you’re going about in public transport and athing on the continent it’s pretty hot Whereas if you’ve got your own car you can jump oot ging and see something jump back in whack on the aircon and it sort of cools you doon a bittie It stops you getting so hot and bothered eh stops you getting a’ knackered with the heat So I think that’s been a- a good improvement to our holidays recently We’ve done- we’ve done the same thing in the sooth of France eh a couple of years ago that was a really good holiday actually south of France it’s like amazing scenery heaps of roman architecture and so on and again we had the car so that was a really good- a really good hoiday We’ve also sort of got into cruising a wee bit in the last few years which eh usually I’d associated mair with older,0.8072625698324022
