 I think my favourite book is probably um sunset song by my own is grass at giving which is a bit of a cliché that’s all probably for some dauern and awfu' of Scotland but it’s also been consistent I’ve always think um Scotland’s favourite novel of the twenty-seven-seven-seven-seven-seven it’s a pretty- a pretty famous book Um it’s a book of a wine-cut dress fae a bide on a farm in an awfu' of Scotland And it’s about the- the struggle that’s been- it’s quite scary isn’t it But it weighs heavily into the witch’s built up and it’s quite scary to look at which a- a flatmate’s favourite book is um- a braw lot of fun and it’s just about eh your own favourite book Um he only connect into the land but also went to her sea of graduation to this extent except back in- so just before the first world war um fann there was no much opportunities for young quines Um and there was a wee expectation that you would buy to hae when my wife and being a mum and Cous has bigger ambitions for hersel Um so it’s part of- part of that and then also the first world war rice and it’s about eh the man that recent awa’ to war and how she wouldnae live in war And eh you know and it’s just- it’s just a wee bit scary to be honest but eh yeah it’s just a wee bit scary to be honest but eh yeah but I dinna ken how I’m doing eh and then I’m getting back oot with my mum and- with my mum a lot of fun just now so um changes them and how it eh how the war impacts on this sma community even though it’s farr awa’ fae farr the wars actually being fought eh and it’s just a really really special novel in terms of the- the languages used it’s in it’s writing in such a different way to meet novels do- do the- the languages so eh almost musical and the way that’s it’s- that- it sinks to you know and it’s just a special bit in it as well Eh but you know it’s- it’s a special bit in it as well and eh it’s a special bit in it as well and eh it’s a special bit in it as well and eh it’s just a special bit in it as well and eh it’s just a special bit in it as well and eh Yeah the wine that’s right of it says- the word orders all in some places and it says- so she- awfu' it gives it a really different quality to other- to other works of pros I think Um and it also is a lot of interesting things to say about the Scottish language versus English language and how um you know how they’ve been valued and different ways and how she feels mair And mostically attached to the Scottish language as well- yeah she’s just an amazing word It’s probably my favourite wine because it’s just a- a great wine that I’ve went back to time and time again and I’ve read bits over and over again If it ever find myself stuck and like I- a train or a plane and I’ve board I’ll bring up the book and I’ll hae a wee wee div or a bit of it um I’ve got a favourite chapter and then I- again by the touch up did a very easy time even so I probably that would- that would hae it with my favourite book ,I think my favourite book is probably eh Sunset Song by Lewis Grassic Gibbon which is a bit of a clichéd answer probably for somebody fae the North-East of Scotland but it’s also been consistently voted I think Scotland’s favourite novel of the twentieth century so it’s a pretty- a pretty famous book Eh it’s a book about a quine ca’d Chris fa bides on a farm in the North-East of Scotland and it’s a’ aboot the- the struggle between eh feeling connected to the land but also wanting to pursue an education So this is set- set back in sort of just before the First World War eh fann there wasnae much opportunities for young quines eh and there were sort of expectations that you would bide at hame and be a wife and be a mam and Chris has bigger ambitions for hersel Eh so it’s partly aboot that and then also the First World War arrives and it’s a’ aboot eh the men that are sent awa to war and how it changes them and how it eh- how the war impacts on this sma community even though it’s far awa fae farr the war’s actually being fought Eh aye and it’s just it’s just a really really special novel in terms of the- the language that’s used it’s- it’s written in such a- a different way to maist novels the- the language is so almost musical in the way that it’s- it’s like- it sings to you the way that it’s written it’s- it’s- the word order’s odd in some places and it sort of throws you off but it gives it a really different quality to- to other works of prose I think Eh and it also has lots of interesting things to say aboot the Scots language versus the English language and how eh you know- how they’ve been valued in different ways and how she feels mair emotionally attached to the Scots language than to the English language So yeah it’s just a- it’s just a fantastic book It’s probably my favourite book because it’s ain that I’ve went back to time and time again and I’ve read bits over and over again and if I ever find myself stuck on like a tr- a train or a plane or I’m bored I’ll bring up the book on my phone and I’ll hae a wee read of- a bit of it Eh I’ve got a favourite chapter and I- I ging back to that chapter and I’ve read it heaps of times So aye proably that would- that would hae to be my favourite book ,0.8438914027149321

Um I need to buy them one of them though it’s fun to see with one of them things Um so far it’s a bit of a mair eh if it’s- if it’s included of cat-glamping it if it’s going on but it didn’t- but it was definitely- it was definitely one of them one of them And eh yeah- aye it was So I think it was the opposite of the way I used to do it but I dinna dinna be interacting with a lot of bands but I dinna dinna be interacting with a lot of things when I was interacting with a lot of things when I was interacting with a lot of things when I was interacting with a lot of things when I was interacting with a lot of things when I was interacting with a lot of things when I was interacting with a lot of things when I was interacting with a lot of things when I was interacting with a lot

it was amazing But yeah I’ve heard that the video afore eh so I can’t be over the- then I thought I did and yeah just a hae like experience the- the sound of the band and just the- the show with the bit on in the graphics for look at this world so eh that’s probably the best experience of the- the story of eh people getting over it and eh playing at the music scene and eh seeing the music scene just eh playing the music scene eh but then I’ve heard that the video afore eh so I can’t be over it and I- I did it and yeah just a hae like experience the- the sound of the band and just the- the show of the bit on in the graphics for look at this world so eh that’s probably the best experience of the- the music scene I’ve been into- and the last couple of years or any way ,I think probably the best gig I’ve ever been to was ain that I wasn’t expecting to be the best gig I’ve ever been to Eh I’ve been to see heaps of bands I’ve been to festivals been to T in the park fann I was younger which was a bit of an experience like up to my knees in dubs Eh I dinna think I would go back to a festival I think I’m definitely- definitely too old to be going to festivals noo Eh I’d need to bide in one of those fancy wigwam things farr it’s a bittie mair eh- fitt do they ca’ it Glamping I’d have to go glamping nooadays Eh so I’ve been to see a lot of bands but aye the ain that I wasn’t expecting to be as good as it was was The Prodigy So we went to see them and it was just a couple of years afore the lead singer died actually I ken they’re still touring but obviously they dinna hae the same lead singer onymair Eh but my other half he was really into them and he wanted to go and see them so I went along and thought “ah okay we’ll go and see fitt they’re like” So it was Prodigy and they were being supported by Public Enemy which was really random But Public Enemy were really cool I kent aboot them obviously and then Prodigy I kent heaps of their tunes but I- fitt- fitt a show they put on It was at Aberdeen eh the old exhibition centre and aye they just aboot took the roof of the place it was an amazing amazing gig And then recently we went to see Bring Me The- eh Bring Me The Horizon eh at the OVO Hydro- the OVO Hydro in Glasgow And again that was ain farr it was mair my other half’s taste in music but they put on an amazing show and the graphics were absolutely stunning Eh so that’s definitely a band that I would ging back and see again if they were ever on tour ‘cause it was a- it was a really good concert and no just the music And I actually kent mair of their tunes than I thought I did I thought I only kent a few of their tunes but then the mair they played I thought “oh aye I’ve-I’ve heard that on the radio afore” Eh so I kent mair than I thought I did and yeah just the whole experience the- the- the sound of the band and just the- the show that they put on and the graphics were oot of this world So that’s probably the best thing I’ve been to in the last couple of years onyway ,1.0450643776824033

 I’ll go on this as a difficult question eh ‘cause I suppose I like different cities where different things eh I’m lucky enough that I’ve been quite a lot of different places I’ve a big fan of Italy but if I was to buy the Italy again to like it’s no really the big city as a suppose it’ve been going to it it’s been mair than the countryside and the brutal t-toskare and stuff Eh interested in city or probably been to the maist it’s probably London because I like that you can go into London and see it as well Eh but I think it’s a difficult question eh for me at the end of my life And there’s always something different on it is the matter that you’ve been there ten times afore and the museum’s a hard-faced exhibition or she was on a’ the time is changing so it’s a city that you can never really get bored of ‘cause it’s always different so my big fun is London and I just I only like the history of it I like the- a very like the culture Um it’d be in full-time when you’d always say we need to gend in the London to see for a’ the money’s being spent evening again Um and it’s just something that you need to gend in a’ for a’ the money that you’ve had as a reason why I didn’t get a bit of a comment aboot it because I really liked it In terms of beauty though I’ve been a lot of city’s a close-a- world and I- I always come back to Edinburgh is just being absolutely stunning I wish

architecture it’s just absolutely stood in um and it’s such a such a special place In terms of international cities that I’ve been to that I felt were civil I think Amsterdam is probably one of the most cities far I felt like I can actually bide here It feels like quite a lovable city I was also recently in some of the school in the U F and that is that amazing city like it’s absolutely stood in- no the countryside is big enough to eh but it’s just- it’s just absolutely amazing So it’s a nice city that I’ve got to meet and it’s just- it’s just absolutely brilliant I’ve got an art and a’ the hills I wouldnae like to walk up again as hills as if we did it’s enough Um but yeah it’s just a beautiful- if you use this different gap in the different colours if we can get to teacher I wish this helps like amazed with other things and school But I’ve no sure if I’ve ever been to buying there ‘cause I dinna ken how I’ve safe and feel I dinna think I’ve ever feel safe in the country that’s

that got me well She’s a great specific and I’ve got a great book She’s a great book She’s a great book She’s lovely to be able to do it in the sense that there’s nothing that does it for me at the moment she’s a great book She’s lovely to be able to do it in the sense that there’s nothing um and- an dementia So I felt we’ve never managed to get a holiday of accordance And then through his family um went to the community centre so I’d passed it onto me and I got the full of accordance of other different remaining isn’s sessions And it was- this was maybe three or four years after one of my grades had died And I dinna really help all of audio or video of material’s in my grannie Eh it was just- it was just three or four years after one of my grades had died And I dinna really help all of audio or video of material’s in my grannie Eh and then after that my- my mum wouldnae let us go to the vet’s in the garden She’d probably say that’s the same as the rest of the world I’ve known how- how she’d known it as a’ But yeah I Um and I’m manage to finally get these tiles to work They were a bit of a charity that I did of every one I win to this busy which was my usual Um and I

got the full recordings of a’ their different reminiscence sessions and it was- this was maybe three or four years after one of my grannies had died and I dinna really hae a lot of audio or video materials of my grannie Eh and I managed to finally get these files to work they were a bittie tricky I had to run them on a Windows PC which- which was my usual and I finally got them to work and

 Aw there’s so money- toys that come to mind Um you know things that I mind the maist I’ve no even sure if it was my toy I think it was maybe my wee Vither is toy that was Strict Armstrong Eh if you mind a Strict Armstrong it was a’ a Plast- to see in money I think- in fact it was made of oot of like rubber and he was full-ray flung awa’ before he was quite next to him and that came fae the kids But he was really strict and you could take you know as a- a poor wee Vither in any way ‘cause he was always playing in the park playing in the park playing in the park ‘cause he was playing in the park ‘cause he was always playing in the park And eh that was- that was my- my wee Vither was a- that was my wee Vither Um And you could- I would study at one end in a lobby of my brother would spend at the other end in the lobby And my mum’d had bed in a bundle so it was a big long lobby and we would stretch about instruction about until he was just about the Hail England in the lobby Or- probably no That’s probably wee exaggerating maybe my childy memories- I’ve been away from the nostalgic but you would stretch away really long Um and then she’ve had spent back into shape eventually But I’m in any day with w- with stressed about much and he exploded And there was this horrible like funny mix of them and eh this is just a very strict minimum Eh and then she’d spent it with my pals- or even with the advent of computers What a shame But I’d spent a’ my mum would do that for a long time And then she’d got her back quite sticky stuff that came over one of my- one of my hours and the awfu' lot of my mam was that f- aie I mind with you and a lot of us a fun with Stret job Um I think that other toys- I mind the maist of course we toys- we’re unevened mind- you mind the maist of the toys that you went to and you never got so I mind the very Christmas way to get the new toys that we went to and we used to join in cutting-out the things that we were needing for something different things that we went to and stuff that we had on the books and stuff that we didnae hae on the books But that was a great fun fact but you know it was a- a great fun just a’ the maist of course and that was a great fun Aye I was what to do Uh it was a good swim man It was a kind of mind-making spaniel no but it was a good swim man it would make slash pupates it would make like ice drinks Mrs Mr frosty that’s a good- Mrs cadmistor for a st- aye it was what Mrs Mr frosty but my mum said that it would just be a sawer and we’ll want to get it Eh but I mind the quines next door and they hid it so we used to go being in play with their hoose And they also had this fae scheme with this big mair fann the quines were getting and getting a wee bit of stuff getting slated in the car and stuff like that but aye that was a good advice Aye that was good What’s the word for teenagers So they even teenagers really like ten or eleven Um it was as told night is game-cut dream phone Eh it was like a board game and it came with a phone It was as far abody ahead phones And you would use a phone and it would phone up different boys Eh and then you had to guess how it’s a boy friend or I can’t like that It was as silly game for quines and it was a bit of eight- I don’t know insolent like the work who had saved by the bill or something like that But aye I mind- I mind- I might probably my best to- I dinna like playing eh a- a boy lover and eh a wee guy that’s a bit of aie interacting with a screen It was just eh quite scary reading the books And eh you would just use a- a bag of wine- eh a wine- a the- the toys that other folk had that he coveted and did the get ,Aw there’s so many toys that come to mind Eh ain of the ains that I mind the maist- I’m no even sure if it was my toy I think it was maybe my wee brother’s toy but it was Stretch Armstrong Eh if you mind of Stretch Armstrong it was this plasticine mannie I dinna ken fitt he was made o- he was like rubber And he was filled with floury white mixture I dinna ken fitt it was but he was really stretchy And you could take ain of his arms and you could- I would stand at one end of the lobby my brother would stand at the other end of the lobby- and my mum and dad bed in a bungalow so it was a big lang lobby- and we would stretch him out stretch him out stretch him out until he was just about the whole length of the lobby- or probably no that’s probably me exaggerating maybe my childhood memories - I’m being a bittie nostalgic But we would stretch him oot really lang and he would spring back into shape eventually But I mind ain day we stretched him ower much and he exploded and there was this horrible like white sticky stuff that came oot of him and it went a’ over the lobby and my mam wasnae awfu’ pleased Eh but aye I mind we haed a lot of hours of fun with Stretch Armstrong Eh I think the other toys that I mind the maist were probably toys that werenae even mine You mind the maist the toys you wanted and you never got So I mind every Christmas we used to get the Argos catalogue oot and we used to try and cut oot the things that we were needing fae Santa Claus Eh and stuff that never- stuff that never came I aieways wanted the- ah fitt was he ca’d Eh he was like a snowman Sno- cannae even mind what he was ca’d noo but he was like a snowman that would mak Slush Puppies It would mak like iced drinks Mis- Mister Frosty that’s what he was ca’d Mister Frosty I aieways wanted Mister Frosty but my mam said it would just be a sotter and we werenae getting it Eh but I mind the quines next door they had it so we used to go roond and play with it at their hoose And they also had this ace game once we were teenagers- or no even teenagers maybe like ten or eleven Eh it was this total nineties game ca’d Dream Phone Eh it was like a board game and it came with a phone and this was a phone afore abody had phones And you would use the phone and it would phone up different boys and then you had to guess fa was fa’s boyfriend or- I cannae mind But it was a- a silly game for quines and it was a bittie- a’- a’ the loons looked like they were oot of Saved by the Bell or something like that But aye I mind- I probably mind best the- the toys that other folk had that I coveted and didnae get ,0.9611111111111111

 In terms of my biggest fear for the future I suppose So I dinna hae kids and I dinna want to take kids I’ve never been particularly emotional um and I’ve never been emotional because it’s- and I feel like it would be just too much I didn’t think I could deal with my life is it is and also hae kids which is been- you’d hate really wanted I’d think and I- I didnae really want it so um there’s- they’ve been seen eh but I suppose I did suppose I didnae want to be dead close to them but I suppose that dinna really have a good couple of days in case they’re a lot older Um and I’ve been quite happy to be able to help them if they know- if I’m dead emotional I totally get my- my grannie and I look at my- my mum and I think about the mind of stuff that I do for my grannie in terms of the lecturing and I think about my mum and dad and like a’ the advent of the day for them I’m definitely the family admin Eh and I wonder- and I’m that age fa’s going to be there to help me with that kind of stuff but I suppose that there’ll be- so my thinking is that by the time I am out- if I’m lucky to get that far fa’ her I’ll be there for a’ so I absolutely love it and I’ll just get it in a’ for my- to see it in a’ the next day Eh and I’m lucky that that guy is a wee guy that’s- just plenty fa’ her and No we plenty of folk are missing the same boat because less and less woman or haeing kids new days compared to previous generations farr it was just expected of you and I’ve got plenty of pals that are haeing kids so maybe somewhere auld our rod is- we’ll join the- we’ll join the-gither in some sort of commuting hae fun get some young cair as I don’t know the only gift of this Um my brother and his wife also they’ve just had a- had a wee quine so I’m a- I’m a an antie So if I’m hoping it if I spinal heart then fann she’s a’ my wee quine she’s a wee quine she’s a wee quine she’s a wee quine um and she’s hoping she’s a wee quine So- so look after them maybe if I’m if I’m lucky ,In terms of my biggest fear for the future I suppose- so I dinna hae kids and I dinna want to hae kids I’ve never been particularly maternal eh and I’ve never really imagined mysel with kids and I feel like it would be just too much I dinna think I could deal with my life as it is and also hae kids just- you’d hae to really want it I think and I- I dinna really want it so eh there’s no- there’s no point in doing it Eh but I suppose I div look at my- my grannie and I look at my- my mum and dad even and I think about the amount of stuff that I do for my grannie in terms of looking after her And I think aboot my mum and dad and like a’ the admin that I do for them I’m definitely the family admin Eh and I wonder fann I’m that age fa’s going to be there to help me with that kind of stuff But I suppose that there’ll be- so my thinking is is by the time I’m old if I’m lucky to get that far there’ll be plenty of folk that are in the same boat because less and less women are haeing kids nooadays compared to previous generations farr it was just expected of you And I’ve got plenty of pals that dinna hae kids so maybe fann we’re older we’ll a’ just- we’ll- we’ll join the-gither in some sort of a commune and hae fun and get some young carers in to look after us Eh my brother and his wife they’ve also just had a- they’ve just had a wee quine So I’m a- I’m an auntie So I’m hoping if I spoil her then fann she’s older she’ll- she’ll- she’ll look after me maybe if I’m- if I’m lucky ,0.6857142857142857

 So I obviously bought a slow cooker and became a bit of a obsessed rate which I think about maybe born and probably definitely a protein middle-age Um but I it’s a great wee thing for- for making um fine food I always have a bit of a problem that’s with meat and then you- you’ve- you would cook meat didn’t be tough and um it’s a- that easy to chat whereas if you do stuff in the slow cooker you just stick it on in the morning leave it to comforters in the ors and then you come to it and it’s a’ fine um- especially when I- when I was younger I had a long time ago but um it’s a- a good- good company um- really enjoyed the- really nicey- hard-working person and they means ten or the taste of good Um so that’s quite an easy wine to- an easy wine to cook and there’s less rational of it the end because you’ve just got the one big part to sticking at sink Um doing my favourite thing to make in its loaker’s it I do a good- a good- a good wee fish too eh so I make it with chunks of beef and that but in carrots and things and mushrooms sometimes Um and then I put in a whole can of gines- some kids eh and then I put in a hell can’t again it’s bloody bloody loose So eh you know- no so- no but eh you know just put in your arms for a wee bit and then get back to your core and- you know just have a wee bit of cake and you know last time you’ve got a wee bit of cake in your core and last and it gives it a really nice find taste evidence So usually that stage- day with it with tatties and then if we’re feeling like true to nursery I’ll be rolling a wee s- where I have tough- paid students like that and the- in the Kelvin industry I’ll be at the top of what to make into a- into a stagpied so that’s what- that’s what you know my maist successful with us- I’m no much of a cuckoo- cuckoo dinna really- I’m no that good at cooking eh and I’m getting better- I’m getting better as I get older and eh yeah I get better and I- get better in a- in a different household and then I’ll be working with a’ the research assistant for a- the research assistant for a- the research assistant for Yeah this load of records definitely been a- a good addition eh with- well I near fire a lot of folk have felt safe so we are fire assistant- we have got an air fire and you know it is- it's good for some things eh but um yeah my- yeah my smokers definitely am I- my favourite thing at the moment ,So I recently bought a slow cooker and became a bittie obsessed with it which I think maks me a bittie boring and probably definitely approaching middle-aged Eh but aye it’s a great wee thing for- for making fine food I aieways had a problem in the past with with meat and you- you would cook meat and it would be tough and eh sort of no easy to chew Whereas if you do stuff in the slow cooker you just stick it on in the morning leave it cooking for hours and hours and then you come to it at night and it’s a’ fine and the meat’s tender and it tastes good Eh so aye it’s quite an easy way to- an easy way to cook and there’s less washing up at the end because you’ve just got the one big pot to stick in the sink Eh probably my favourite thing to mak in the slow cooker is I- I do a good slow cooker beef stew Eh so I mak it with chunks of beef and a- and carrots and ingens and mushrooms sometimes Eh and then I pour in a whole can of Guinness and it gives it a really really fine taste Eh and then so usually when we hae that stew we hae it with tatties- mashed tatties And then if we’re feeling like treating oursels I’ll maybe roll oot a wee square of puff pastry and stick that in the- in the oven and then stick that on the top of it to mak it into a- into a steak pie So that’s probably ain of my maist successful recipies I’m no much of a cook I dinna really-I’m no that good at cooking Eh I’m getting better I’m getting better as I get older And eh yeah the slow cooker has definitely been a- a good addition Eh we’ve- we’ve got an air fryer A lot of folk are awfu’ obsessed with air fryers just noo We have got an air fryer and yeah it’s- it’s good for some things Eh but eh yeah my- my slow cooker’s definitely my favourite thing at the moment ,0.8461538461538461

 favourite subject at the scale was probably Spanish and probably with favourite because I was good at it right me Um I came natural to us and I liked it idea being able to speak aboot folk and they didnae ken what you were on a bit has been reason why I think for learn and the language is so you can speak aboot folk behind their back and they did it or- doing behind their back right to their face by the dinner ken what you’re saying That’s the holidays and the language really isn’t it you,Favourite subject at the school was probably Spanish and probably my favourite ‘cause I was good at it I reckon eh became natural to us and I liked the idea of being able to speak about folk and they didnae ken what you were on aboot That’s the main reason I think eh for learning a language is so you can speak about folk behind their back and- or no even behind their back right to their face but they dinnae ken what you’re saying that’s the hale reason to learn a language really innit ,0.42105263157894735
 I think my favourite subject was probably history I quite like the learning about a lot of different eh time periods we went a’ the way back and spoke about eh my neolithic Scotland I mind eh learn aboot sca' to brain and then finally being able to go there and I was all in up for me as well and I was an adult It was pretty pretty cool Eh and we did- we did quite a bit of Scottish history learning about like as I say we’ve back in the a’thing at times but also we couldn’t the mair recent history at Scotland like it’s to like eh Britain and Britain in the sense that we had to eh get away from Scotland quite a bit because we were both- we were both dead funny Eh we were both dead quite a good Scottish history like it was eh quite difficult to get to get to know But I still think it’s just- I think it’ I mean I suspecting about like two in planit and other new toon to the Scotland to take it right up to date Um so I really enjoyed that and then we also do a lot of world history as well And basically um the world history that recovered is obviously in modern history and a lot of it was to do with like the second world war Eh we did a lot of bits of the wide’s movement in America that kind of thing I did it really mindy and ken you also see in question of things like Napoleon and eh war And eh we also see um the nineteenth-century French art class Uh we see here in the world-class Theos- the French art class Um and we also see here in the world-class Theos of the world war of the roses all the sort of bars of English centre history I suppose It’s only mind- everybody much of that Um I mind- mind- but it’s stuff like the bars and the bandit and boy and my lesson work the books and all that kind of stuff that’s Scottish stuff but I dinna ever really mind touching on stuff much fang of history or stuff like the cheaps or anything like that We didnae really cover that in high school there was much more I focused on- on Scottish history which is as- as writing about it It’s good and I wine Um there’s a lot of it and I also think it’s braw And I- like getting over the speck of fun and getting over the speck of fun in the- the kind of stuff that folk- folk’ve kent about eh and then upstairs in the bar there and all that stuff in the bar So it was mair of Scottish history than world history and mair of modern history eh but it was to conflict and so on so that was probably you know my favourite subject I had a great history teacher he was absolutely fantastic and a mind he- he used to say history is everything eh but I think he was family- he’s probably right enough with that because eh if you look at the state of world noo the days I think if we’ll go look back at history and try and understand the way the things I’ve happened before we might name that – same with the st- alongside him it’s a great story for us but how it felt as if we were younger noo but eh the world was amazing just to look at it Again and again and again and again so I think history probably is a’ it- wish you be- pay and make attention to it ,I think my favourite subject was probably history I quite liked learning about a’ the different eh time periods We went a’ the way back and spoke aboot like neolithic Scotland and I mind eh learning aboot Skara Brae and then finally being able to go there fann I was old enough when I was- was an adult It was pretty- pretty cool Eh and we did- we did quite a bit of Scottish history learning aboot as I say way back in neolithic times but also looking at the mair recent history of Scotland Looking at stuff like eh- I mind speaking about like toon planning and a’ the new toons in Scotland So taking it right up to date eh so I really enjoyed that and then we also did a lot of world history as well Maistly eh the world history that we covered was maistly modern history and a lot of it was to do with like the second world war Eh we did a lot aboot the civil rights movement in America that kind of thing I dinna ever really mind doing- ken you always see it in quiz shows and athing stuff aboot like the Napoleonic Wars and eh War of the Roses a’ the more sort of English centred history I suppose I dinna really mind ever doing much of that eh I mind learning aboot stuff like the wars of independence and William Wallace and Robert the Bruce and a’ that kind of stuff the Scottish stuff but I dinna ever really mind touching on stuff much fae English history or stuff like the Tudors or onything like that We didnae really cover that in my school there was much mair a focus on- on Scottish history which I suppose is- is right and proper- it’s good in a way Eh so it was mair Scottish history than world history and mair modern history eh related to conflict and so on So that was probably my favourite subject I had a great history teacher he was absolutely fantastic and I mind he- he used to say “history is everything” eh I think he was probably- he was probably right enough with that because eh if you look at the state of the world nooadays I think if folk would look back at history and try and understand the way that things have happened afore we might no mak the same mistakes again and again and again and again So I think history probably is athing We should be paying mair attention to it ,0.7842227378190255

 I’m not sure if there’s like the one John or a’ that like I think I like a’ that kind of stuff Um I really like- I quite big fun at the back of sort of surreal of stuff Um stuff like when I my great Um I’ve got a cop- have got a divist that one of his pictures is that um the- what’s the called called Conda I think it’s ca’t So it’s got a’ the manate that are fan for this guy Um it’s a pretty- but it’d cool been it I’ve never had the same mannerisms for him Um but I dinna think it’s a’ that kind of stuff is like happening with the cop- have got a cop- have got a cop- have got a cop- have got a cop I’ve got a- yeah I’ve got a cup of that myase Um to else do I like let me think I quite like- awfu' really I really like the work of eh Elette’s library I think his stuff is brilliant I think it’s such a good representation of like just in dust general working-class eh life- if he had certain periods I think it’s just really really eh if I’ve got it If I was doing in Manchester for eh eh my- my kids in England- eh in England eh and we’ve got a cup of eh our classmate’s a’ really good company Eh and we’ve got a cup of eh food and stuff happening over there Eh and we’ve got a bucket list over there Eh and then eh the next bucket list is eh sorted and sorted and sorted and sorted and sorted out places that we’ confidence they long ago and I went to the library with A- even self- herid and it was just so interesting the time about as life- he lives E- he lived such a like humble life and eh I watched this film recently aboot him in his mum and he really used to talk to each other to be as mam and it was just- it’s such a shame fann you get artist’s- it was no really a value of much in their own life times but they’ve eh achieved great sense E- just wish of it like a woman’s of an argument but she’s no talking about it She’s just funny but she’s funny and everything about that isn’t dirty overrated and it’s funny because like I don’t know that would be a shame it was a good time to be a kitten and be able to live in a garden in a back and see um on the ken back and getting forward you wish to keep ken forward and see how um loved and aye with your that art um because I dinna really get the appreciation of the- the nine life times So I really like life is art eh I felt- it’s- it’s no absolutely jump in terms of like single artist’s I like fa- fae that as one of the nine to gain with the national Gallery eh and eh it felt really friendly and I was like “oh no got enough of it ” so aye just the eh kind of got a roof over me eh and I’ve always had that in mind but I dinna really get any actual reward from it eh and just try and get an actual reward from it I like the- I did different painted- to like all the historical ones for you know it’s special you know what’s one of the- I believe you can great- that’s a brilliant painting where it’s just eh you can see a’ the emotions playing out in a’ these places as well It’s a- it’s a really great painting Eh yeah it apart from that there’s nothing really jobs these are there ,I’m not sure if there’s like one genre of art that I like I think I like a’ different kinds of stuff Eh I really like I’m- I’m quite a big fan of the mair sort of surrealist stuff Eh stuff like René Magritte Eh I’ve got a copy of- got like a canvas of one of his pictures it’s eh the- the- what’s it called Golconda I think it’s ca’d Farr it’s got all the mannies that are fa’ing fae the sky Eh that’s a pretty- pretty cool painting I’ve got a- yeah I’ve got a copy of that in my hoose Eh fitt else do I like Let me think I quite like- ah I really- I really like the work of eh L S Lowry I think his stuff is brilliant I think it’s such a good representation of like just industrial working class eh life fae a certain period I think it’s just really really eh evocative I was staying in Manchester for a conference no long ago and I went to the Lowry museum in Salford and it was just so interesting to learn about his life He lived- he lived such a like humble life and eh I watched a film recently about him and his mam and it was a toxic relationship that he had with his mam and it’s just- it’s such a shame when you get artists that were no really valued much in their own lifetimes but they’ve eh achieved great success since You just wish a bit like with Vincent Van Gough- you just wish that they could ging back and- and see eh- not they ging back- ging- ging forward- you wish they could ging forward and see how eh loved and how revered they are eh because then they would really get the appreciation that they deserved in their own lifetimes So I really like Lowry’s art Eh fitt else There’s nothing else that’s really jumping oot at me in terms of like single artists I like fann- fann I’m doon in London I like to ging roond the National Gallery and hae a look at the- the eh- a’ the different paintings I like the historical ones farr you know especially- you know- what’s the one with eh Lady Jane Grey That’s- that’s a brilliant painting where it’s just eh- you can see a' the emotions playing out on abody’s faces It’s a- it’s a really great painting Eh yeah but apart fae that there’s nothing that really jumps oot at me ,1.0187793427230047

it’s it’s it’s quite hard to- if you dinna hae a car or if you’ve been drinking if you cannae drive a car it’s quite hard to get a game And in terms of the region I really like farr I bide in the North-Eastbody in this- it’s farr I’m fae I feel we cannae connect it Eh and it’s just- it’s quite a hard-working person in the- the North-Eastbody in the It is a bit of pain though because we feel a bit eh woot the way- no as bad as if we’ve a bed in Shell in the work media that can hae any must feel a must be- must be hellish up there in times of remoteness But even in an artist ken we didnae get the really good bands coming up here for concerts they’ll just go into the mental belt and also holidays like the direct fly options for everybody in our prep time So if you want to go and holiday- yeah they’re painted with a painted gun and that’s great for- for families of- for families of dogs and things like that they’re painted with a painted gun and stuff like that It is a bit of pain though because it’s a bit of pain though because it doesnae feel a bit of a pain though but because it would feel a bit of eh woot the way But yeah we’ll do it all day in- at the end of your holiday you’ve got this two-and-a-half oor three year if it’s ever dry if or you can even get started or if it’s covered up before you can get a’m so that’s a bit of what it means sometimes,So I bide

terms of fitt I dinna like about farr I bide It’s a bit of a hassle to get hame fae a night oot if you’re oot at the pub or oot with your pals Eh there’s a bus once every hour but even if you get the bus you get off the bus and it’s pitch dark and it’s like a mile walk up a road with no pavement our hoose So it’s no exactly a good end to a night oot Eh so I tend- hae to bide at my mam and dad’s ‘cause they bide eh in a- in a- in a toon no- no- no oot in the countryside So that’s one of the no handy aspects aboot it Biding in the country is- it’s- it’s- it’s quite hard t- if you dinna hae a

feel really connected to it Eh it is a bit of a pain though because we feel a bittie oot of the way no as bad as if we bed in Shetland or Orkney I dinna ken how they must feel it must be hellish up there in terms of remoteness But even in the North-East ken we dinna get the really good bands coming up here for concerts they all just ging to the central belt And also holidays like the direct flight options fae Aberdeen are pretty dire So if you want to go on holiday you end up haeing to fly fae Edinburgh or Glasgow which means that at the start of your holiday and at the end of your holiday you’ve got this three and a half hour three hour fittever drive eh afore you can even get started or afore you can get hame So that’s a bit of a pain sometimes ,0.8706739526411658

 It says a difficult aim ‘cause I absolutely love holidays Like I just live for holidays I think that’s learning all of the reasons it that that I work is so that I can afford to get in holidays So I’ve really lucky that I’ve been lots of that really cool places Um best holiday to everyone’s the I think Every s- w- a few years ago we went to Italy and we’d been to Italy quite a few times before but it’s time We were all just absolutely lucky and I’ve been to Italy and it’s a lot of people from eh the age of twenty-seven and we were both- we were both- all three of us know had a great time with us and it was so good that we were both- it was so noisy outside of the house And it was just really good And we went to the car and we bed in a few different places- I’ve had different hotel and so I bought out- and I think that was really good- I really good holiday with saw- that’s a lot of like I did I think you can beat Italy for food like pizza is in the past and I dinna haeing it’s so fine and I ice cream Um and I think compared to previous holidays fann we’d been in like France that we spent on um it was a first time with roond at the car abroad and it makes a big pot Uh but why didn’t you do a gap year ago and I think it was really good- it was really good- went back and done really good with a sawing of the car abroad and it made sure it was- it was a good rapport with old folk and eh yeah it was really good different in terms of the amount of stuff that you can see but it also makes them big different in terms of the air conditionates because if you’re got a bit of public transport and athing in the continent it’s pretty hot whereas if you’ve got your own car you can jump oot- get you and see something- jump back in fa’come on the air cone and it’s at a close you doon a bit of it- it stops you get into the head bothered eh stop you getting on the- get an underdog- so I think that’s been a- I- I get fruit but they’re obviously- we dinna we’ve doon the same thing get in the same distance- walk away fa’ look at the- walk away fa’re a’ the dug and that’s hotdog eh and it’s hotdog eh It’s eh a couple of years ago That was a really good holiday I actually decide the front so it’s like that- amazing scene of me Heaps of road with architecture and so on eh and again went to the car so that was a- I really could hardly good holiday We’ve also said I’ve got a decroosing a wee bit in the last few years which eh usually I associate it near with alcohol- or Folk of my parents generation but eh actually really really enjoyed it because you just walk an up and up in a new place every day Um the food maybe gets a bit of semi- the food’s no quite good It gets a good rapport to eh once I understand what- what it really does and what it’s going to do with a- what eh and I’d probably love it It’s good on the crowd’s um but I in a bit of places that you can back in seeing in like a couple of weeks and ken- marriage into go to different countries and it’s like a couple of weeks It’s a- it’s a pretty good way to see the world ,This is a difficult ain ‘cause I absolutely love holidays like I just live for holidays I think that’s one of the only reasons that- that- that I work is so that I can afford to ging on holidays So I’m really lucky that I’ve been lots of really cool places Eh best holiday ever let’s hae a think I recent- a few years ago we went to Italy And we’d been to Italy quite a few times afore but this time we rented a car and we bed in a few different places a few different hotels and sort off potted it oot And I think that was a really good- a really good holiday we saw lots of places Like I dinna think you can beat Italy for food like pizzas and pasta and athing it’s so fine a’ the ice cream Eh and I think compared to previous holidays farr we’d been in like France Italy Spain and so on eh it was the first time we’d rented a car abroad And it maks a big difference in terms of the amount of stuff that you can see but it also makes a big difference in terms of the air-conditioning because if you’re going about in public transport and athing on the continent it’s pretty hot Whereas if you’ve got your own car you can jump oot ging and see something jump back in whack on the aircon and it sort of cools you doon a bittie It stops you getting so hot and bothered eh stops you getting a’ knackered with the heat So I think that’s been a- a good improvement to our holidays recently We’ve done- we’ve done the same thing in the sooth of France eh a couple of years ago that was a really good holiday actually south of France it’s like amazing scenery heaps of roman architecture and so on and again we had the car so that was a really good- a really good hoiday We’ve also sort of got into cruising a wee bit in the last few years which eh usually I’d associated mair with older folk and my parents’ generation But I actually really really enjoyed it because you just waken up in a new place every day eh the food maybe gets a bittie samey the food’s no quite as good on a cruise Eh but aye the amount of places that you can pack in seeing in a couple of weeks and ken managing to go to heaps of different countries in the space of a couple of weeks it’s a- it’s a pretty good way to see the world ,0.8067415730337079

 My favourite teacher was my French teacher because he was- he was just fantastic He was just fantastic He was – even in the maist and despite his teachers that you cannae ever ask for Um I was so feared of him for a start of when I first started secondary school He was naturally my French teacher He was eh just the scary money that would g-games with the school And even though he was English- he was English teaching in Scotland but he only ever spoke French so if he spoke to you in the carrador he would expect you in front of- the- the school for eh in the first place But he also spoke to me about eh his teacher was a- the teacher was a great teacher he spends a lot of time with us but he also spoke to us when we were younger And if you came with the- your class you’m suspecting of the other teacher- he would bowl his big influence And if you ever covered your class as a- like a supposed to do teacher ‘cause your teacher was awfu' no well he would always be convinced So I do ten-fide o- ‘cause if you did the spoke French or if you were just learning it like we were in first year It was- it was pretty ten of fine Um and then in my third year I got him as my teacher like eh openly- he became a teacher for some of the good French and hire- hire French I mean He you know- he was a great teacher he retrained along- along the way He eh had a great time a’ the way he works And eh we all got a class that was eh that was eh based in French but eh we all got a class that was eh based in good old age that was And yeah once he was my actual teacher as well I got it because the immersion process for our own in a language definitely works better than eh just bits here and there So once he was actually my teacher and he was always big to enjoy it he always made that in really fun eh he was- he was- he was songs that he would send to just things with friends and he just- I really- I really good sense of humor And when he used to- I always love it as much as I- as well I would just concentrate on it and get it in a wee bit and just concentrate on stuff that folk didnae see us on it And yeah it was just amazing- I remember when I was just desperate eh and we were always quite happy just to watch and watch all these things that our parents didnae see us on it And yeah it was my actual teacher’s a lot of it in another teacher would come into the class Can you be in the middle of your class maybe The debt that you had would come into asked a question or- again in the teacher would come into asked to speak to a people eh and this teacher- he would only expect to only do the came into his room in French so we used to look forward to folk coming in asked for a question to see them getting a eh getting a- help on the nuclear fann the dinnertime they liked their supply in French so like he was great but eh yeah it would be really good fun just to watch him for the good fun just to watch his- his family eh and then just to put that in mind and watch his family for the good eh and just to watch him for the good eh and just to watch him for the good fun just to watch his family for the good fun just to watch his family for the good fun just to watch the good fun just to watch the good It was really amazing- useful way to teacher that I worked in the maist way Um if it also- it’s just been a total character ,My favourite teacher was my French teacher because he was- he was just fantastic He was ain of the maist inspiring teachers that you could ever ask for Eh I was so feart of him for a start So fann I first started secondary school he wasnae actually my French teacher He was eh just this scary mannie that would ging aboot the school and even though he was English- he was English teaching in Scotland but he only ever spoke French So if he spoke to you in the corridor he would speak to you in French and if he came into your classroom to speak to another teacher he would only speak in French And if he ever covered your class as a- like a substitute teacher ‘cause your teacher was off no well he would only speak in French So abody was terrified of him ‘cause if you didn’t speak French or if you were just learning it like we were in first year he was- it was pretty terrifying Eh and then in my third year I got him as my teacher like eh permanently He became my teacher for standard grade French and then Higher French And yeah once he was my actual teacher I sort of- I got it Because the immersion process for learning a language definitely works better than just bits here and there So once- once he was actually my teacher and he would only speak to you in French you saw how- how effective it was And he was a great teacher he- he aieways made athing really fun eh he aieways- he would hae songs that he would sing to teach us things aboot French and he just had a really- a really good sense of humour And we used to aieways love it fann another teacher would come into the class Ken you would be in the middle of your class and maybe the deputy head would come in to ask a question or a guidance teacher would come in to ask to speak to a pupil Eh and this teacher he would only speak to onybody that came into his room in French So we used to look forward to folk coming and asking a question to see them getting a’ eh- getting a’ hot up under the collar fann they didnae ken the way to reply in French So aye he was- he was really amusing and he’s probably the teacher that I learnt the maist fae Eh but also the teacher that stands oot as just being a total character ,1.0390804597701149
 My opinion on AI I think is- is genius but it’s also quite scary because it’s like computer-ship computer-ship turning you’ve lost all your data you know this is a kind of a robotic I’m try to find out what it works with me- make explained in it or how I feel about it I just feel it’s genius with us also this is a kind of internet as well that is- it doesnae sound right with me you,My opinion on AI I think is it’s genius but it’s also quite scary because it’s like computers- if computers shut doon and you’ve lost all your data you know this is a kind of a robotic- I- I’m trying to find how to put it into words with m-m-ake- explaining it how I feel about it I just feel it’s genius but there’s also- there’s- there’s a concern aboot it as well that is- it doesnae sit right with me ,0.38271604938271603
 AI s- what’s my thoughts on AI it’s a good thing ‘cause eh it’s taking over the world and I’ve always been fair though I dinna think there’s anything really to be fair the folk are like skirt the- the henna like said devices in the hoose and that ‘cause she’s a listening- because she’s a listening but what’s anybody saying in the hoose that centred us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitters and us fitt I’ve got a gie of hoot Come at me in so- aye that’s the way it’s going to bring it on let’s there if you cannae bits I’m enjoying them eh ,AI’s- what’s my thoughts on AI It’s a good ain ‘cause eh- it’s taking over the world and abody’s feared of it and I dinna think really there’s anything to be feared of Folk are like scared of haeing Alexa devices in their hoose and that ‘cause she’s aie listening well of course she’s aie listening but what’s anybody saying in their hoose that’s interesting enough for Mr Bezos and the rest of them to listen to and get your- what are you up to ken what I mean what’s folk up to that they think’s so interesting that Bezos or the rest of them are going to- are going to gie a hoot ken what I mean So AI that’s the way it’s going bring it on let’s do it if you cannae beat them join them eh ,0.8561151079136691
 I think with lots of AI or but you next I did a ken if it’s maybe a gives me kind of of a bad thing Um I work at university so fae that perspective It’s a bit of it you concern if you see you students getting themselves in a bit of a mid-up by eh can no site and things properly or- or site and things that did an even exist or you can see that there’s just a- a basic level of understand that it’s coming across as well It’s a bit of an inherent way of living And eh you know sometimes it’s a bit of like a bit of a eh bit of AI that you know somewhat strict with a guy which eh- I don’t know quite- I think it’s a bit of- it’s just- it’s kind of- it’s kind of- is an inherent way and some eh of certain assignments that might be coming through AI it’s- it’s hard to tell sometimes Eh I think it needs a wee thinking and the way that we assess folk in Higher education contexts I think beyond education there’s definitely- there’s a lot to be gain fae AI I think Um I can’t some day work to the hospital and there was such a big eh college assistant that might surprise you aboot the- the kids doing their jobs and things Um and you know getting- getting friends with them and eh yeah getting friends with friends eh and I think- aye that’s been a good gig and I’ve always had that many highs and lows and lows and lows and it was just absolutely brilliant So I cannae wou how AI is being used potentially-� is spot eh with cancer and scan- and stuff like that and how it can actually be a bit of mair eh never liable but mair academic dinner it can close this thing as quick as the- the humans can So I think- and terms of that kind of thing there’s maybe you know a lot of- a lot of good that you can come fae it fae eh AI usage I also think that- I think it’s a bit of a mair optimistic and I- as well that’s good and I’ve got a lot of good stuff that I’ve got and I’ve got AI and the fact that we have got AI in this particular team and eh AI and eh AI and that’s something that most people do and they like good times that they’re happy and eh AI and eh AI Well probably shouldnae be too feart of it Um it’s going to happen whether we went to turn it out or in part- wrongy eh everybody’s going to happen I dinna think you can put the g- back in the ball no Um so I think it’s coming and we just need to try and work out why as to for most ethical usage AI so that folk eh ken if they’re dealing with it gets you just once a bit of fear because they’re playing in the park and it’s quite a simple mix but you know it’s no use at all It’s just fun which is amazing to me at the moment eh but I dinna really think it’s going to happen but eh but I dinna really think it’s going to happen But aye I’m- hopefully I’ve done it And then eh my partner’s There’s obviously a bit of concern about jobs and so on you see like um and nie’s just last week the government works for kind of about using AI for steamline and processes and stuff like this um but hopefully we can use it to be mair efficient and eh covered up about the way that we do stuff and maybe that'll feed up us to do things that are made interesting instead of eh the government things that AI can maybe take us our hands ,I think my thoughts aboot AI are a bittie mixed I dinna ken if it’s going to be a good thing or a bad thing Eh I work at a university so fae that perspective it’s a bittie concerning fann you see students getting themselves in a bit of a rid up by- ken no citing things properly or- or citing things that dinna even exist or you can see that there’s just a basic level of understanding that’s coming across in some written assignments that might be coming fae AI It’s- it’s- it’s hard to tell sometimes Eh I think it needs a rethinking of the way that we assess folk in higher education contexts I think beyond education there’s definitely- there’s a lot to be gained fae AI I think Eh I ken somebody that works at the hospital and they were speaking aboot how eh AI is being used potentially to spot eh like cancer in scans and stuff like that and how it can actually be a bittie mair eh no reliable but mair accurate and it can process things quicker than- than humans can So I think in- in terms of that kind of thing there’s maybe you know a lot of- a lot of good that can come fae A- fae- fae- AI usage I also think that we probably shouldnae be too feart of it Eh it’s going to happen whether we want it to or nich- or- or no Eh but it is going to happen I dinna think you can put the genie back in the bottle noo Eh so I think it’s coming and we just need to try and work oot ways to promote ethical usage of AI so that folk eh ken fitt they’re doing with it and it get’s used responsibly There’s obviously a bit of concerns about jobs and so on You see like eh in the news just last week the government were speaking about using AI for streamlining processes and stuff like this Eh but hopefully we can use it to be mair efficient and cleverer about the way that we do stuff And maybe that’ll free up us to do things that are mair interesting instead of the boring things that AI can maybe take off our hands ,1.0337662337662337
 I think it’s a lot of damage has been done in the internet in the past eh years to the world in you know false information being given in people are dead ill disorder they’ve not in really to the source they just take it as face value because it is quite access to get this information and it’s ruined a lot of people’s life and repute things eh and I think that is a lot of damage because it’s a lot of damage because it’s caused by the police eh you know getting it in a false dawn I think it’s caused by damage because it’s unvaccinated eh it’s a lot of damage because it’s unvaccinated eh from damage because it’s unvaccinated eh it’s unvaccinated eh and I think that is a lot of damage because it’s a lot of damage because it’s the sadness of how quick people can get that access ,I think there’s a lot of damage being done on the internet in the past um years to the world and you know false information’s been given and people have taken it literally They’ve not went really to the source They just take it as face value because- and it’s quick access to get this information and it’s ruined a lot of people’s lives and reputations Um and I think that is the sadness of how quick people can get that access ,1.146341463414634

 I really dinna want to say- so if we do anything like this- I think social media is great and the eaps of eyes it’s good for eh seeing if it’s got on in the world fiding in it aboot places that you- even the normally kind of aboot eh hearing different voices across a world and stuff and just for out keeping up your pals is stuff like that But I dinna think that the hame eh influence our culture that’s grown up roond about social media that it’s just a bit of a false dawn you know And so the- the things that I think we do in the- the society that we eh is really good- maybe just maybe just- it’s a bit scary to be honest but I don’t think that the- the mair- the social aspect of the world is really good just to try and keep up with our- the kids and Very serious stuff Um the last two years when I’ve been in holiday ken you can different cities in Europe and the America Um whenever you’re on a big two-year spot it’s just- it’s so ken- should be in your seat they’re in a folk that are like pleasant and like really unusual cultural poses for their social media of food So it’s all just about genuine and content so you see’s folk doing Um you know different silly nonsense that can be a publicating thing for them So yeah it’s- it’s just- it’s funny You can’ve always been like quite a simple person but eh a social aspect is a bit of a strange thing but eh yeah it’s- it’s just- it’s so serious and it’s no really unusual for a- a special person but eh it’ ‘cause I can suppose it’s a’ to their- they’re haeing fun but um I made sure V’s fun I also get to a bit of an effort I also get a bit of hard work to be on this area Eh we were on the safe-a-fairns last year and we saw this um white feart husband he just a’glam and made up in a funny folk and we wrote this bunny like to our side of it said a site of seeing like beauty And um she was absolutely radio-actual so she was a-actual eh and she was a- the kind of guy that came over the years ago and it’s a’ the fact that we were on the phone and we were just reading the heid- the photies and it’s a’s a’ the photies that we had in our class and it’ She was fumann because folk wouldnae move awa’ fae the site for she was to give away because- busy it was a height of somewhere There was heaps of folk there to see the views but she seemed to think that because she needed to take a fae thirty-fair in Instagram but our day is just cleared off and in clear the way- and she was running and raiding and she wasn’t happy and she was rigid at husband and eventually- has been clear a’ the other two days to do it to themy- and she was- she was so- she was such a beautiful wifey but she was so rigid and rigid and rigid and she didnae hae anyroad with no other kids in it in the same mannerisms or even the same mannerisms or eh no even the same mannerisms or eh no even the same mannerisms fae the same mannerisms noo just yet to look after But I gie with wage because she was so angry at the situation that it wasnae just aboot her and it wasnae just aboot her and it wasnae just aboot her getting her fae eighteen and the way that she went it to um but then in a second as soon as the camera’s worked on him she through a hair back and it was all over the floor it was in all the beautiful and idealing like fairies you know like and I just thought ah how fae ‘cause that eh how faecause that and then once it’s finished hae up to take in the pictures She was the happy of the picture she was vegien of her husband ‘cause it wasnae kind of picturesque of the picture she was faeien sure of eh and I- I had no regrets eh but I gie with wage Anyroad it wasnae just aboot her she was so angry at the situation that I’m with them tatt So next day I get and I just stop off in the hard work I’m to a hard- hard life you love your life just for like social media ,I really dinna want to say social media because I think social media is great in heaps of ways It’s good for eh seeing fitt’s going on in the world finding oot aboot places that you- you wouldnae normally ken aboot eh hearing different voices fae across the world and stuff and just for keeping up with your pals and stuff like that But I div think that the whole eh influencer culture that’s grown up roond aboot social media is just a bittie wearisome Eh the last few years fann I’ve been on holiday ken oot in different cities in Europe and in America eh whenever you’re in ony big tourist spot it’s just- it’s so cringe fann you see the amount of folk that are like posing in like really unnatural poses for their social media feeds And it’s all just about generating content so you see folk doing eh you know different silly dances oot in public so they can post it to their TikTok account and that kind of stuff Which you know each to their own I suppose they’re- they’re haeing fun but eh I’m no sure if it’s aieways fun It looks like it’s a bit of an effort It looks like hard work to be honest with you Eh we were in the sooth of France last year and we saw this eh wifey and her husband and she was a’ glam and made up in a fancy frock and we were at this bonnie tourist site- (inc) a site of scenic beauty and eh she was absolutely raging she was fuming because folk wouldnae move awa fae the site farr she wanted to take her photo because it was busy it was the height of summer there was heaps of folk there to see the views but she seemed to think that because she needed to tak a photo for Instagram that abody else should just clear off and- and- and clear the way And she was ranting and raving and swearing and she wasnae happy and she was raging at her husband And eventually the husband cleared a’ the other tourists oot of the way eh and she was- she was so- she was such a beautiful wifey but she was so ugly with rage because she was so angry at the situation that it wasnae just a' aboot her and it wasnae just aboot her getting her photo taken in the way that she wanted to Eh but then in a second as soon as the camera switched on she threw her hair back and it was a’ aboot the pose and a’ of the beautiful and ideal and fairytale-like and I just thought “Oh how fake is that eh How fake is that ” And then once they’d finished taking the picture it was- she wasnae happy with the picture and she was raging at her husband ‘cause it wasnae the kind of picture that she wanted him to tak so they had to do it again And I just thought “Oh what hard work” Must be a hard- a hard way to live your life just for likes on social media ,0.9549718574108818

 So I grew up in a place that invader in the North-East of Scotland eh was a sort of medium-sarties team when I was going up was big enough but- big enough to be a two-year-old definitely no a village Eh and aye we did we had a run on the place when I was younger than our bikes and we used to eh but the only real was film I’m the way to be back by the time when the- the street lights came out on its own or a back by then we were fine so it was a great night for me So we off in our bikes up to the park Um the used to be woods up the back of the two of them used to get to eh- would go into the river If our eyes were still never going in the river so of course we did being kids Um so yeah it was- it was a good place to- to grow up in a lot of freedom And it’s also a good-sized of two because it’s got a lot of young shops and it’s got a lot of extra on some of the stuff to do Um and with a big school- it wasnae like getting a little home from- to school or having kids in school or maybe just a wee bit of stuff that I did eh but it also has a good- it’s a good- it’s a good- it’s a good- well I had a good couple of years ago but I also have buckets and things like that Um it’s a good- a good side school- since like as we um everybody has like- gets- I don’t know but we check hold inside so I don’t know to the keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and every year of their building new us it’s and it just seems to be a bit aboot a control So I say that in three new days isnae really the team that I grew up in Um it still got its core there- so like the hardy two but doing it is definitely- I’m not much much bigger place and there’s much more full but um just as we- as we said in the SECC at the time it’s a good- a good- a good- a good- a good- a good- a good- a good- a good- a good- good company Um and it’s- it’s I would say that was a good to do with a guy that’s a good guy that’s a good guy that’s a good place to grow up I did think I would’ve like to grow up in a big city like I ever did and I think eh growing up in the two was better And even though I’ve a wide-ninth country side of the world I dinna think I would’ve liked them and I’ve liked them and I’ve always been kind enough to look after them Eh and I’ve always liked them and- and I’ve always liked them and- and I’ve always liked them and- and I’ve always liked them and- and I’ve always liked them and- and I’ve always liked them and- and I’ve always liked them and I’ve always liked them and- and better in the countryside as a kid ‘cause you’d have been so polite in your moment that’s tack-y onywhere whereas bide in the to- do you week it get out get your bikes do you get um and there was plenty of- plenty of mischift to get up to-,So I grew up in a place ca’d Inverurie in the North-East of Scotland Eh it was sort of a medium sized toon fann I was growing up It was big enough- big enough to be a toon definitely no a village Eh and aye we had the- we had the run of the place Fa- fann I was a kid we used to be out on our bikes and we used to eh- the only rule was fae my mam was that we had to be back by the time that the streetlights came on as long as we were back by then we were fine So we’d be off on our bikes up to the park eh there used to be (inc) up the back of the toon that we used to ging to we’d ging doon to the river And we were always telt “never ging in the river” so of course we did being kids Eh so yeah it was- it was a good place to grow up and a lot of freedom and it’s also a good-sized toon ‘cause it’s got plenty of shops and it’s got plenty of restaurants and plenty of stuff to do eh and we had a big school it wasn’t like a (inc) little country school where abody kens each other Eh there’s a good- a good-sized school Since I was wee eh Inverurie has grown like it’s I don’t know probably tripled in size or something It keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger Every year they’re building new hooses and it just seems to be a bittie oot of control So I would say that Inverurie nooadays isnae really the toon that I grew up in Eh it’s still got its core there it’s still got the heart of the toon but it’s definitely a much much bigger place and there’s much mair folk in there that are no originally from Inverurie folk that have moved there fae other parts of Aberdeenshire because it’s become a bit of a- a bit of a commuter toon So it doesnae maybe have the same eh character that it used to but it’s got mair shops noo which is a good thing it’s got some bigger shops eh But yeah it was a good- it was a good place to grow up I dinna think I would’ve liked to grow up in a big city like Aberdeen I think eh growing up in the toon was better and even though I bide in the countryside noo I dinna trhink I would’ve liked to have bed in the countryside as a kid ‘cause you’d have been so reliant on your mum and dad to tak you onywhere whereas biding in a toon you could get oot get on your bike do what you liked eh and there was plenty of- plenty of mischief to get up to ,0.7752577319587629
